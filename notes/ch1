System language
"Spirit of C"
    Trust the programmer
    Don't prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done
    Keep the language small and simple
    Provide only one way to do an operation
    Make it FAST
C standard defines the language and final authority of language behavior
Can't understand C behavior just by writing test code; behvaior varies between
    a lot of things

Need to compile programs written
Programs end in .c
